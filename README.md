RoomCull is a performance optimization mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that implements intelligent room-based occlusion culling. By detecting room boundaries and creating frustum planes at walls, floors, and ceilings, RoomCull dramatically improves rendering performance by hiding geometry that shouldn't be visible from the player's current position within enclosed spaces.

Perfect for large builds, underground bases, and complex interior structures where traditional frustum culling isn't enough to maintain smooth framerates.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automatic Room Detection** - Scans in all directions to detect walls, floors, and ceilings
- **6-Plane Frustum Culling** - Creates proper frustum planes at room boundaries 
- **Real-time Boundary Updates** - Periodically rescans for changes in room structure
- **Visual Debug Particles** - Red redstone particle beams show detected room boundaries
- **Glowstone Room Block** - Place to define room centers and enable occlusion culling
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal overhead with intelligent caching and cleanup

## üéÆ How It Works

1. **Place Room Blocks** - Place the glowing room block at the center of enclosed spaces
2. **Automatic Detection** - The mod scans up to 50 blocks in each direction to find walls
3. **Frustum Creation** - Creates 6 culling planes at the detected room boundaries
4. **Selective Rendering** - Only renders geometry inside the room when you're inside it
5. **Visual Feedback** - See red particle beams showing the detected room boundaries
